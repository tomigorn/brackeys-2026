# Brackeys 2026 — Game Jam Starter

Welcome — this is a minimal, no-pressure starter README for my first Brackeys-style game jam. The goal is to experiment, learn, and make a small playable prototype without strict deadlines or heavy commitments.

**Project:** Brackeys 2026 — small experimental prototype

**What this repo is for:**
- Quick experiments and prototypes for a game jam.
- Track decisions about tools, assets, scope, and workflow.

**Goals (short & simple):**
- Make a single, playable scene or mechanic in 1–7 days.
- Keep scope tiny: one core mechanic, one short level, minimal polish.
- Learn a new technique or sharpen an existing one.

**Tools & Software:**
- **Engine:** Unity (recommended) or Godot — pick one and stick to it.
- **Code:** C# for Unity, GDScript/C# for Godot.
- **Version control:** Git + GitHub (use small, frequent commits).
- **Art:** Aseprite / Krita / free asset packs.
- **Audio:** Bfxr / Audacity / freesound.org for SFX and simple music.

**Workflow (suggested):**
1. Choose one idea and write a one-sentence pitch.
2. Break it into a tiny checklist (see Checklist below).
3. Prototype the core mechanic first (no polish).
4. Iterate: add a simple level, then basic UI, then polish if time.
5. Export a build early and test on target platform.

**Checklist (example):**
- [ ] One-sentence pitch
- [ ] Core mechanic working (prototype scene)
- [ ] Basic player controls
- [ ] One short level or loop
- [ ] Simple UI (start/restart)
- [ ] Exported build

**Scope tips:**
- Prioritize fun over completeness — a small, complete loop > many unfinished features.
- Use placeholders: greyboxes and temporary art are fine.
- Limit platform targets (desktop first).

**Assets & Licensing:**
- Prefer free or self-created assets. Keep track of sources and licenses.
- Note credits in a CREDITS.md file if using third-party assets.

**Notes & Next Steps:**
- Brainstorm ideas in `ideas.md` and pick one to start.
- Create a simple project template in `project/` and commit initial scene.

Have fun — this is a learning exercise. No pressure, just make things and iterate.
